<h2>What is SyllabiShare for?</h2>
<p>
  SyllabiShare was developed as an open-source project to empower students to crowdsource a public repository of course syllabi that are essential to make informed course selections and to understand course policies.
  To find out information about a course before the first day of class, you would usually go to a friend or RateMyProfessor, but if you didn't know anyone who took the class before and there are no online reviews for the class, you would need to email the professor for a syllabus and hope they respond... yeah right, good luck with that.
  With this tool, users will be able to upload, search, and download syllabi for students at their university to use.
  It is ludicrous that students can pay tens of thousands of dollars to their university and not have access to such materials already.
  Fortunately, some schools have a syllabus repository like this already, but not nearly enough schools do.
  All of these are reasons why we made this tool and made it open-source for students of any university to adopt and improve.
  If you can get your university to sponsor your fork of the app, please do let us know and we'll redirect to yours.
  Please feel free to add to the codebase or join the team if you feel inclined to help the effort.

<h2>Testimonials</h2>
<p>"I think it would benefit our students and potential students if more faculty members participated in this. I know that many student and friend groups keep copies of all syllabi and share them amongst themselves. I think posting them publicly on a site like this helps level the playing field for students who do not belong to those groups. It also seems like this would make my life easier, having students get my syllabi without dealing with all the personal requests through email. I'm glad you are working on this." ~ Prof. Raymond Pettit, UVA Computer Science</p>
