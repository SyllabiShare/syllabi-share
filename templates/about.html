<h2> What is SyllabiShare for? </h2>
<h6> SyllabiShare was developed as an open-source project to empower students to crowdsource a public repository of course syllabi that are essential to make informed course selections and to understand course policies. To find out information about a course, you would usually go to a friend or RateMyProfessor, but if you didn't know anyone who took the class before and there are no online reviews for the class you would need to email the professor for a syllabus and hope they respond... yeah right good luck with that. With this tool users will be able to upload, search, and download syllabi for all viewers at their university to enjoy. It is ludicrous that students can pay tens of thousands of dollars to their university and not have access to such materials already. Fortunately, some schools have a Syllabus repository like this already, but not nearly enough schools do it. All of these are reasons why we made this tool and made it open-source for students of any university to adopt and improve. If you can get your university to sponsor your fork of the app please do let us know and we'll redirect to yours. Please feel free to add to the codebase or join the team if you feel inclined to help the effort.</h6> <br>

<h2> Technical Details </h2>
<h6>This app was written in Python using the Django Framework and is hosted on Heroku, with files being served through an Amazon Web Services S3 Bucket in Northern Virginia. This will eventually cost money, so I will once again ask for your financial support and ask that you click the Donate link at the bottom of the screen if you are in the financial position to. We understand if you can't thought, we're all college students here. The code is on Github <a style="color: purple" href="https://github.com/verndrade/syllabi-share">here</a> or in the bottom right corner of your screen.</h6>
